# Review of Functions and R

A **function** (in the computer science sense of the word) is a collection of code that is attached to a name.  There are three important components to every function:

* The inputs to the function (also known as the parameters or arguments)
* The code itself
* The output returned by the function.

In the languages that we will use (R and Python) new functions can be defined in code.  The expression used to define a function is broken down into two parts:

* The function header: determines allowed arguments
* The function body:  the code to be executed
    
In R the function header is the line containing the keyword `function`.  The word `function` is followed by parenthesis and the **argument list**.  For example:

```{r}
function(n){
  n+1
}
```

This is an **anonymous function** because it hasn't been given a name:

```{r}
my.func<-function(n){
  n+1
}
```

We have now created a function called `my.func` which will take one valud as an argument, add one to that value, and return the result.  Let's look at the details a bit more closely:

The **argument list** is the values between the parenthesis.  In this case:  `n`.  That means the argument is called `n`.  The **function body** is `{n+1}`.  If there is not an explicit **return** function, then the value of the **last expression** is the the value of the function.  So, `my.func(3)` evaluates to the value `4`.  Remember, in R, `+1` can be applied to vectors of numeric type too... so `my.func(c(1,2,3))` would return a vector with the values `2,3,4`.

Let's look at a function with two arguments:

```{r}
my.subtraction = function(x,y){
  x-y
}
```

Be sure to type this in your console.

Notice what happens we we apply this function to 5 and 3:

```{r}
my.subtraction(5,3)
```

R uses **named arguments**.  In this case the function takes **two arguments**.  The first is named `x` and the second is named `y`.  We can **pass a named argument**:

```{r}
my.subtraction(y=5,x=3)
```

Notice that even though the 5 and the 3 occur in the same order, the results are different.  This is because in the first example we did not use **naming** when calling the function.  Without naming the arguments the values are assigned "first-come-first-served".  Since `5` was first and `3` was second, they were assigned to `x` and `y` respectively because that is the order in which the arguments appeared in the function parameter list.

In the second example we were explicit about the names of arguments.  Naming an argument over-rides any order considerations.

**Rules so far**:   
If an argument in a function call is named (example, `my.subtraction(y=5,x=3)`) then assign it to the appropriate variable (if it occurs in the parameter list-- attempting to use an invalid name will generate an error).  **After named arguments are assigned** assign values based off of order on the remaing **unbound** variables.

Example:  `my.subtraction(y=5,3)` will assign a 5 to `y` (because it's named), but then assign the 3 to `x`, because that is the first (and, in this case only) unbound variable.

**default values**:   
A **default value** can be assigned to a variable.  This value will be assigned to the local variable if not over-ridden in the function call:

```{r}
my.subtraction = function(x,y=5){
  x-y
}

my.subtraction(10)
```

In the function call `my.subtraction(10)` no naming was used, so the values are assigned by order.  Hence `x` is given the value of 10.  There is no value specified for `y`, but it has a default value of `5`, so that is the value that it receives.

# Basic R data types

* Everything **evaluates** to a value
* Everything is an object

## vector
Most fundamental data type is a **vector**:

* numeric
* character
* logical
* factor

We usually build vectors using `c()`, or the sequence operator `:`

```{r}
c(10,20,40)
1:3
c("bob","anna","bob")
```

vectors can have the `names` attribute.  Either upon construction or added later:

```{r}
mv=c(x=10,y=20,z=30)
mv
mv=c(10,20,30)
names(mv)=c("x","y","z")
```

### subsetting vector elements

We typically use the `[]` operator.  

* vector of positive integers
* vector of logical values
* vector of character values

```{r}
mv>=20
indices=mv>=20
indices
mv[indices]

mv[2]
mv[c(2,3)]
mv[-2]
mv[c("x","y")]
```

### Using named vectors to make **lookup tables** (hashes)

```{r}
set.seed(1234)
x=runif(100)
cat=cut(x,3,labels=c("low","medium","high"))
cat2color=c(low="green",medium="yellow",high="red")
oldpar=par(bg = 'gray')
plot(x,col=cat2color[cat],pch=20,cex=1.5)
par(oldpar)
```

### Recycling

recycling is done when possible, be it for numeric operations or for indexing:

```{r}
mv=1:10
mv
mv+1
mv+c(1,2)
mv+c(0,10,100) #warning... but still works:
mv[c(TRUE,FALSE)]
names(mv)=letters[1:10]
```
## matrix
A matrix is a vector with a `dim` attribute:

```{r}
bob=1:100
dim(bob)=c(20,5) #20 rows and 5 columns
bob
```

Notice the way in which the numbers fill the array.  Ensures that caching is more likely for values in the same column.

Here are two more, perhaps more informative, ways to build the same matrix:

```{r}
matrix(1:100,nrow=20)
matrix(1:100,ncol=5)
```

Can assign `rownames` and `colnames`:

```{r}
bob=t(bob) #transpose of bob # now 5 rows and 20 columns
colnames(bob)=letters[1:20]
bob
```

### Matrix indexing

Can access matrix entries using:

* Single number indexing
* Comma separated indexing
* commas with blanks (all)
* numeric vector indexing
* numeric vectors separated by commas
* logical vector indexing
* logical vector indexing separated by commas
* 

```{r}
pairs=outer(letters,letters,paste0)
names(bob)=pairs[1:100]
bob["ac"]
bob[2,"f"]
bob[1:2,2:4]
coords=rbind(c(1,3),c(2,4),c(1,1))
coords
bob[coords] #loses colnames and rownames, but retains names
```

Specific column, specific row
## Finding entries:

```{r}
which(bob<=20 & bob>=15)
which(bob<=20 & bob>=15,arr.ind=TRUE) #stored as a matrix.
```
###Recycling

Remember, a matrix is, secretly, just a 1-dimensional array.

**discuss recycling**

```{r}
bob+1
bob+1:5
bob[c(TRUE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE),c(TRUE,FALSE)]
```

** discuss negative values**

```{r}
bob[-2,]
bob[,-2]
bob[,(-2):(-5)]
```

Forcing the dimension attribute to go away:

```{r}
c(bob)
```

### dimnames array

Discuss

* rownames
* colnames
* dimnames
* names

## Lists

Lists have a `names` attribute.  It is the primary data.type for holding all sorts of things.  with the `attach` (or `with`) command the names in a list can, effectively, be turned into variables.  The `list` data type allows for the use of `$` construction

```{r}
l=list(nums=1:20,letters=letters[1:10],recur=list(age=47,names=c("peter","dolan")))
```


## Data Frames

Replaced, in the tidyverse with the `tibble`.  There is also a package called "data.table" which has some very nice properties (see https://kykimeng.com/posts/intro-to-data-table/).  We'll use plain data.frames for now.

All columns must have same length (will recycle if it can):

```{r}
anna=data.frame(nums=1:10,letters=letters[1:5])
```

rownames, colnames, dimnames, names Are very similar, but not identical.  `colnames` and `names` are synonyms for data.frames.

data.frames ALSO have the `$colname` construction:

```{r}
anna[,"letters"]
anna[,2]
anna$letters
```
A dataframe is a `list` with a `class` attribute of `"data.frame"`.  (The system enforces the same-length requirement).

## Making Decisions

In R the main structures for controlling the **flow** of the program are:

* `if`
* `for`
* `while`

The `if` construction allows for an optional `else`.  The overall structure of the complete form is:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
if(condtion){
  # Run if condition is true
} else {
  # Run if condition is false
}
```

Here is an example:

```{r}
n=10
if(n>5){
  cat("Greater than five")
} else {
  cat("Not greater than five")
}

n=4

n=10
if(n>5){
  cat("Greater than five")
} else {
  cat("Not greater than five")
}

```

This construction allows R to **make a choice**.  It does not, however, allow for loops.

### Loops

Our first loop is the `for` loop:

```{r,eval=FALSE}
for( var in object){
  # code to execute
}
```

The idea here, is that the `object` contains a number of entities.  The `#code` is execute once for each element in the `object`.  For example, if the object is the vector `1:10` then the code will run 10 times.  Each time, the value of `var` is set to the next entry in the object:

```{r}
for(num in 1:5){
  cat(num,"\n")
}
```

It's most common to use sequences constructed using the `:` operator (like in the example above), but one can also use lists.  Whether a vector or a list, any extra attributes are ignored-- so a matrix acts like a one-dimensional vector and the loop is run once for each entry.  Similarly, a data.frame is really a list whose entries are the columns in the data.frame-- so a for loop run on a data.frame will run once for each column.


The R commands `break` and `next` allow one to 

* exit the loop (`break`)
* skip to the next iteration (`next`)

Although they are not **flow control** in the normal sense of the word-- there are also functions that sequentially apply a function to various entries:

* lapply-- applies a function once to each entry in a list
* sapply-- does the same thing but tries to simplify the output
* apply-- applies a function to each row (or each column) of a matrix or data.frame

There are other variants, but these are the ones that I use most commonly.

In classic R loops were very slow and it was usually faster to find a way to use `lapply` or `sapply`.  Modern R uses bytecode and so I'm not certain if it's still faster to use `lapply` or not.  IN fact, in certain cases it is definitely slower since both `sapply` and `lapply` make a large output vector whereas a for-loop doesn't have that overhead.

My advice is now a bit different then it had been the past-- use `lapply` and `sapply` where it makes sense (when you have a vector or list that you would like to transform by applying the same function to every entry) and use a `for` loop when iterating over a sequence makes the most sense-- An example of the latter would arise from collapsing a vector or list into a single value.  (think of an operation such as `sum` as an example... however, `sum` is best performed by the `sum()` function since that loops in C at a much faster rate.).  In many cases, R functions are already **vectorized** which means the function will automatically apply itself to every entry in a vector.  Consider, for example, `nchar` which returns the number of characters in a string:

```{r}
names=c("Peter","Amy", "Heather", "Ryan")
nchar(names)
```
We could get the same result using `sapply`:

```{r}
sapply(names,nchar)
```
The advantage of using `sapply` in this situation is that the resulting vector has the names of the original character values (which we might, or might not, want).

In other languages the idea of applying a function to every element in an array (what R calls a vector is known as an array in most other languages) is known as **map**.  Condensing all the values in an array down to a single value (perhaps by adding them together) is known as **reduce**.

```{r}
for(i in 1:10){
  if(i==3){break;}
}
cat(i)
```
### while loops

If `for`-loops capture the idea of repeating a set of actions for a specified amount of time, then `while`-loops capture the idea of repeating an action "as long as necessary".  The basic construction is 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
while(condition){
  # code to execute
}
```

Similar to `for`-loops, the `break` command will exit the while loop.  Let's look at a non-trivial example.  Here is the idea:

1. Take a positive integer.  
2. If the number is even divide by 2
3. If the number odd then multiply by 3 and add 1 ($3n+1$)

Repeat this process until the number $1$ is reached (the observant among you :

```{r,eval=FALSE}
looper=function(n){
  n=floor(n) # Ensure that the input is an integer
  if(n<=0){stop("n must be an integer greater than 1")}
  loop=c(n)
  while(n!=1){
      #You will write this code in an exercise.
  return(loop)
}
looper(41)
plot(looper(41),type="b",ylab="value",xlab="index")
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
looper=function(n){
  n=floor(n) # Ensure that the input is an integer
  if(n<=0){stop("n must be an integer greater than 1")}
  loop=c(n)
  while(n!=1){
    if(n%%2==0){
      n=n/2
    } else{
      n=3*n+1
    }
    loop=c(loop,n)
  }
  return(loop)
}
looper(41)
plot(looper(41),type="b",ylab="value",xlab="index")
```

Look at what happens if we find the lengths of these loops for the first 1000 elements:

```{r}
#loops=sapply(1:100000,function(n){length(looper(n))})
loops=sapply(1:1000,function(n){length(looper(n))})
plot(loops)
```


## Piping in R

You've learned about `|`, `>`, `>>`, `<`, `2>`,`2>>` in unix shells.  But there is **also** a form of piping in R.  The package `magrittr` (look up [René Magritte](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Magritte) and you too will be in on the joke):

![This is not a pipe](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b9/MagrittePipe.jpg)

The R package `magrittr` overloads the `%>%` operator (for example)

The basic construction is 

```
lhs %>% rhs
```

The lefthand side should represent a value (or be a magrittr placeholder)
The right hand side is a function call

Examples of use:

unary function: `x %>% f` is, mostly, equivalent to `f(x)`

f with other arguments: `x %>% f(y)` is, mostly, equivalent to `f(x,y)`

Using `.`:  `y %>% f(x,.)`  will replace `.` with `y`


We can also use anonymous function (if we are careful about our parenthesis):

```{r}
library(magrittr)
3 %>% (function(n){n+1})
```

## Web Scraping

We need data, so let's recall some of our web-scraping experiences.  We'll use the `rvest` package which, similar to `magrittr` overrides `%>%`.  It makes use of `xml2`:

```{r}
library(rvest)
url<-"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_and_territories_of_the_United_States_by_population"
url %>% read_html() %>% html_nodes(xpath='//*[@id="mw-content-text"]//table[1]') %>% html_table() -> population
population<-population[[1]]
```

It's probably been awhile... but let's think about what's happening.

The `url` is passed to `read_html()` which, essentially, opens up a connection to the page.  The `html_nodes()` function creates an R object that corresponds to nodes described using *xpath* or *css* (we are using xpath).

If you think of `read_html()` as making a local copy of the **tree* associated to the document, then `html_nodes()` extracts all the desired nodes.  Recall, that in an HTML (or XML) document, the nodes corresponds to all the TEXT encompassed by the corresponding tags... so we are, essentially, getting ALL the tables.

Xpath                      | meaning
---------------------------|-----------------
`//`                       | Descend as far as necessary to find
`*[@id="mw-content-text"]` | nodes with the id "mw-content-text" 
`//`                       | Continue descending
`table[1]`                 | Until you find the first table

Surprisingly we actually get 3... that's because there is more than 1 table that matches this description-- if we leave out the `[1]` we get **five** tables-- the `[1]` ensures that we don't get SIBLING tables-- but other tables at different depths in the tree are still fair game because of the second `//` in the XPATH.

## POPQUIZ

Return the names of all states with populations less than one million

```{r}
population[[5]]=gsub(",","",population[[5]]) #Remove the comma's
population[[5]]=gsub("\\[\\d+\\]","",population[[5]]) #Remove the footnotes
population[[5]]=as.numeric(population[[5]])
population$name[population[[5]]<1000000]
```

Notice the use of regular expressions again?  That's probably been awhile too.  Think about reviewing them.

Now do a subtable with the state name and the population

```{r}
population[population[[5]]<1000000,c(3,5)] #the short way
```
